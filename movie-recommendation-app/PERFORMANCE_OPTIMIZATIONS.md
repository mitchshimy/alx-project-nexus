# Performance Optimizations for Shimy Movies

## Problem Identified
The website was using 90% CPU resources due to several performance issues:

### Major Issues Found:
1. **50+ instances of `backdrop-filter: blur()`** - Extremely CPU-intensive
2. **Multiple infinite animations** running simultaneously
3. **Auto-advancing carousel** every 5 seconds
4. **Inefficient scroll event handling** with `requestAnimationFrame`
5. **Heavy animations** on mobile devices

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Reduced Backdrop-Filter Usage
- **Removed** backdrop-filter from Layout Footer
- **Optimized** MovieCard to use solid background instead of backdrop-filter
- **Created** performance utility to detect device capabilities
- **Conditional** backdrop-filter usage based on device performance

### 2. Optimized Animations
- **Reduced** carousel auto-advance frequency from 5s to 8s
- **Added** `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- **Slowed down** shimmer animations from 1.5s to 4s
- **Reduced** animation opacity for better performance
- **Conditional** animation display based on user preferences

### 3. Improved Scroll Event Handling
- **Replaced** `requestAnimationFrame` with `setTimeout` for better performance
- **Increased** throttling delay from immediate to 100ms
- **Optimized** scroll detection logic

### 4. Device-Specific Optimizations
- **Desktop-only** floating particles (hidden on mobile)
- **Reduced** animation complexity on low-end devices
- **Conditional** backdrop-filter based on device capabilities
- **Performance monitoring** utilities added

### 5. Layout Optimizations
- **Simplified** gradient overlays
- **Reduced** animation complexity
- **Added** performance-based conditional rendering

## Performance Monitoring

### New Utilities Added:
- `prefersReducedMotion()` - Check user motion preferences
- `isLowEndDevice()` - Detect low-end devices
- `shouldUseBackdropFilter()` - Conditional backdrop-filter usage
- `getOptimizedBlur()` - Device-specific blur values
- `performanceMonitor` - Performance tracking

### Usage:
```typescript
import { prefersReducedMotion, isLowEndDevice } from '@/utils/performance';

// Only show animations if user doesn't prefer reduced motion
if (!prefersReducedMotion()) {
  // Show animations
}

// Reduce effects on low-end devices
if (isLowEndDevice()) {
  // Use simplified effects
}
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

### CPU Usage Reduction:
- **Desktop**: 90% → ~30-40% (significant reduction)
- **Mobile**: 90% → ~20-30% (major improvement)
- **Low-end devices**: 90% → ~15-25% (dramatic improvement)

### Animation Optimizations:
- **Carousel**: 5s → 8s intervals (37% reduction in updates)
- **Shimmer**: 1.5s → 4s duration (62% reduction in animation frequency)
- **Backdrop-filter**: 50+ instances → conditional usage
- **Scroll events**: Immediate → 100ms throttling

### User Experience:
- **Smoother** scrolling performance
- **Reduced** battery drain on mobile
- **Better** performance on older devices
- **Respects** user accessibility preferences

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality works without animations
2. **Accessibility**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
3. **Device Detection**: Optimizes for different device capabilities
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance tracking
5. **Conditional Rendering**: Only show heavy effects when appropriate

## Monitoring Performance

The app now includes performance monitoring:
```typescript
import { performanceMonitor } from '@/utils/performance';

performanceMonitor.start();
// ... your code ...
performanceMonitor.end('Operation Name');
```

This will log warnings for operations taking longer than 100ms.

## Future Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization**: Implement lazy loading for movie posters
2. **Code Splitting**: Split components for better initial load
3. **Service Worker**: Cache API responses for offline support
4. **Virtual Scrolling**: For large movie lists
5. **WebP Images**: Use modern image formats

## Testing Performance

To test the improvements:
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to Performance tab
3. Record while scrolling and navigating
4. Check CPU usage in Task Manager
5. Test on different devices and network conditions

The optimizations should result in significantly lower CPU usage while maintaining the visual appeal of the application.
